# Question

Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer

properties need to have double quotes "".
"name": "Zo",
"isCool": true,
"age": 8,
Needs another , next to 28.
can use nested arrays of objects, dont use a comma for last line of code.

JSON Types
Strings
Numbers
Booleans
null
Arrays

JSON
You'd want to work with an array or object since just having 1 value etc would be a waste for an entire file.

JavaScriptObjectNotation

Data Representation Format like XML OR YAMO

Commonly used for APIs and Configs, Game, text editor , vscode

Lightweight, easy to read/write

integrates very well with javascript since javascript is just superset of javascript meaning anything you write in json is valid in javascript.

Almost every single major language has some sort of library to parse json strings into objects
