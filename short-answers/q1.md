# Question

When would be a good time to use an array instead of an object, and vice versa? Please provide examples.

# Answer

You'd want to use Array when you know you'll need to index ordered data. Arrays also allow for frequent manipulation.
List of numbers, list of strings.

Use objects when you need quick retrival of values via their keys.
object would be better for storing information about a person with keys like "name," "height," and "car."
