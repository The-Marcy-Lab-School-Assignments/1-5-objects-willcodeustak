# Question

What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer

Pass by value is not mutable while pass by reference is.

Pass by value creates a copy ensuring immutability

meanwhile pass by value references its original value, meaning any chances done will have affects on main code.
